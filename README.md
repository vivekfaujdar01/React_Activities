- Activity: Todo list with localStorage
- Activity: Fetch and display API data with useEffect
- Activity: Form validation
- Activity: Routing between pages
- Activity: Custom hook examples

Tech stack
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React
- HTML / CSS
- Optional: testing with Jest/React Testing Library

Getting started

Prerequisites
- Node.js (recommended LTS, e.g., >= 16)
- npm or yarn

Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/vivekfaujdar01/React_Activities.git
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
   or
   yarn install

Running locally

  or
  yarn dev

Open http://localhost:3000 (CRA) or the port shown by Vite to view the app.

Building for production

Project structure (example)
- /activities — folders for each activity (e.g., activity-01-counter)
- /public — static assets
- /src — shared code and root app
  - /components — reusable components
  - /styles — global styles
  - index.js / App.js

How to add a new activity
1. Create a new folder in /activities, e.g. activities/activity-XX-name
2. Add a README.md inside the activity folder describing learning goals and instructions to run (if it’s standalone).
3. Implement the activity in that folder (or integrate in src with routing).
4. Add a link/menu entry in the main app so the activity is discoverable.
5. Open a pull request describing the activity and goals.

Available scripts (update to match your project)
- npm start — start dev server (CRA)
- npm run dev — start dev server (Vite)
- npm run build — create production build
- npm test — run tests
- npm run lint — run linters
